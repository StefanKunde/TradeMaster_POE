Will take some time to finish.


UPDATE:
Updated for DELIRIUM league.

This is an overview application for the game Path of exile.
You can search for currencys and maps with it and you will instantly get the tradetext to your clipboard.
So just paste it in and fire it up!

You know the pain when you need to trade in this game, dont you?
This app is for all the people who feel the pain!
